<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">
Simple Screen Recorder is a tool that allows users to record their screen activity and audio. Here are instructions on how to use the Simple Screen Recorder to create screen recordings and audio recordings.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>
<p align="center">

- Select audio input/output devices from dropdown menus.<br>
- Choose codec, file format (MKV recommended), and framerate.<br>
- Select monitor to record or capture all.<br>
- Choose audio recording method.<br>
- Files saved in "Recordings" folder.<br>
- Use "Media Merge" to combine audio and video.<br>
- Option to record audio only in "Audio Recordings".<br>

<h2 align="center">Important installation and use notice for Simple-Screen-Recorder</h2>
To ensure that Simple-Screen-Recorder functions correctly without any issues related to video recording, please adhere to the following guidelines when choosing a location:

**Avoid using the application in the Program Files**  directory or any other system-protected areas that might require elevated permissions.

**Avoid lengthy file paths.** For example, avoid paths like C:\Users\lextrack\source\repos\lextrack\Simple-Screen-Recorder\bin\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0\publish\win-x64\Recordings as they can lead to issues with file management and recording functionality.

**Do not rename the application's folder.** Renaming could lead to issues with accessing the necessary files for recording.

To prevent **Windows UAC prompts from interrupting recording**, you should select the second-to-last option, which says "Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop)". Or, if you want, completely disable it.

Where can you **install the app**?

- Your "Documents" folder.

- Or extract it in a simple root directory, such as "C:\Simple-Screen-Recorder".

I have made another <a href="https://github.com/lextrack/MiniScreenRecorder">screen recorder</a> for Windows and Linux. It is even simpler and lighter, and the resulting video recording is in MP4 or MKV format with included audio without the need for conversion. Additionally, it allows recording a specific area of the screen.
